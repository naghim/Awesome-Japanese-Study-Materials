## Learn the language 

### Books ðŸ“–
You can download most of them from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B1wSkra_KicPn_1d8Wv9tQUJ0C9CZOzP?usp=drive_link).

Highly recommended (just pick any):
- **Genki**: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese and its workbook series
- **Minna no Nihongo** series

*Others I picked up as a beginner:*
- Beginning Japanese for Professionals (by Emiko Konomi)
- Teach Yourself Japanese (by J. C. Dunn and S. Yanada)

#### For kanji
- **Remembering the Kanji** (by James W. Heisig)
- **The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course** (by Andrew Scott Conning)

### Apps ðŸ“±
- **Duolingo** [[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo) // [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128)] - a highly recommended app. Itâ€™s effective for building foundational skills in Hiragana, Katakana, and even Kanji. The lessons follow a well-structured pace that keeps learning engaging without overwhelming. It provides solid practice in grammar and listening. Best of all, itâ€™s free to use, making it accessible to everyone, although after making some mistakes (3-4), you need to wait some time to use it again. A subscription is available to access unlimited practice sessions. **Recommend!** ðŸŽ‰
- **LingoDeer** [[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lingodeer) // [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lingodeer-learn-languages/id1261193709)] - a language learning app tailored for Asian languages, including Japanese. It offers structured lessons with a focus on grammar, sentence structure, and pronunciation, making it ideal for building a solid foundation. Again, most content is locked behind a paywall. **Highly recommend!** ðŸŽ‰

#### Other apps:
- Anki Flashcards - haven't tried yet, but I heard only positive opinions so far.
- [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) to learn kanji.
- KanjiStudy

#### Apps to learn new words
- **Drops** [[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.languagedrops.drops.international) // [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drops-language-learning-games/id939540371)] - good for learning new words, practicing reading and listening.
